                        History is as important of a subject now as it has been throughout time. The lessons of history are not learned by regurgitating names or dates (although still important). The importance of history is to understand what the human race has valued and experienced over time, and the changing of those values and experiences with thought and action.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Stories of the past find themselves lost on people living in an age of rapid technological progression and global commerce; yet without the retelling of those stories and the passing down of values we would not stand where we are today. What we largely take for granted is the fact that thousands of years of human development have ammounted to what we are today. Therefore, the study of history to me is to appreciate what past people have done and derive from their actions and teachings the values that move us foward as a race.

                    <p>
                        Bootcamp was undoubtedly one of the most challenging experiences I have went through. The workpace was fast, within the first two weeks we had already learned the basics of HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Github. After a month of coding we could host our own application locally on a server using Node.js/express and eventually learned how to host and deploy our applications to Heroku.

                    <p>
                        Although graduation felt great as it came and went, it taught me something valueable. I have to be self reliant on pushing myself foward in every situation, I can not wait for someone to hold my hand and carry me along. Just a month after graduation this would hit me as I was struggling and had no professor to turn to.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There were countless nights I have had my face in front of a computer screen and questioned my existence. I was so dissapointed in myself for not getting a job within the first three months of graduation, but I did not give up. I continued to study on my own and practice my code making my own applications. The next lesson I gained from my experiences in web development would be in perseverance as no matter how many barriers I hit, I would continue to slam against them until I broke through.

                    <p>
                        Coding is difficult; it takes time, discipline, and dedication to understand, but that does not make it impossible. This is the mentality I needed to embrace and to continue to hone my skills further. Web development was not something that started as a passion for me, but it is something I have grown passionate about. Web development for me has been an experience of growth and self reflection.
